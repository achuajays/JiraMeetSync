# JiraMeetSync - AI-Powered Meeting to Jira Ticket Automation

## Overview

JiraMeetSync is an intelligent automation system that transforms meeting transcripts into actionable Jira tickets using AI agents. The system leverages **CrewAI**, a multi-agent orchestration framework, to analyze meeting discussions and automatically generate well-structured Jira tickets for development teams.

## What Does This Project Do?

This project solves a common problem in software development and project management: **converting meeting discussions into trackable work items**. Instead of manually reviewing meeting notes and creating tickets, JiraMeetSync:

1. **Analyzes PDF meeting transcripts** using AI
2. **Extracts actionable items** and ticket requirements
3. **Automatically creates Jira tickets** with proper formatting
4. **Saves development time** by eliminating manual ticket creation

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
The project uses a **multi-agent architecture** powered by CrewAI, where specialized AI agents collaborate to complete complex tasks:

- **Agent Collaboration**: Multiple AI agents work together, each with specific roles and expertise
- **Sequential Processing**: Tasks are executed in a logical sequence to ensure quality output
- **Tool Integration**: Agents use specialized tools to interact with external systems

### Core Components

#### ü§ñ AI Agents

**1. Ticket Understander Agent**
- **Role**: Meeting Ticket Understanding Specialist
- **Responsibility**: Analyzes meeting transcripts and extracts actionable ticket information
- **Tools**: PDF Reader Tool
- **Expertise**: Natural language processing, requirement extraction, context analysis

**2. Jira Ticket Creator Agent**
- **Role**: Jira Ticket Creation Expert  
- **Responsibility**: Converts extracted information into well-structured Jira tickets
- **Tools**: Jira Ticket Creation Tool
- **Expertise**: Jira workflows, agile processes, ticket formatting

#### üõ†Ô∏è Specialized Tools

**PDF Reader Tool**
- **Purpose**: Extracts text content from PDF meeting transcripts
- **Technology**: PyPDF2 library for PDF parsing
- **Input**: File path to PDF document
- **Output**: Plain text content of the meeting transcript

**Jira Ticket Creation Tool**
- **Purpose**: Creates tickets directly in Jira using REST API
- **Technology**: Atlassian Python SDK
- **Features**: 
  - Supports multiple issue types (Epic, Story, Task, Subtask)
  - Configurable project targeting
  - Error handling and validation
- **Authentication**: Username/password or API token based

## Technical Terms Explained

### CrewAI Framework
**CrewAI** is a multi-agent AI framework that allows you to create teams of AI agents that work together on complex tasks. Think of it as a way to have multiple specialized AI assistants collaborate on a project.

### Agent-Based Architecture
An **agent-based system** uses multiple independent AI agents, each with specific roles and capabilities. This approach offers several advantages:
- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on what it does best
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents for new capabilities  
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one agent don't affect others
- **Reliability**: If one agent fails, others can continue working

### Sequential Processing
**Sequential processing** means tasks are completed one after another in a specific order:
1. Extract information from meeting transcript
2. Create Jira tickets based on extracted information

This ensures that each step has the required input from the previous step.

### YAML Configuration
**YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)** is a human-readable data format used for configuration files. The project uses YAML to define:
- **Agent configurations** (`agents.yaml`): Roles, goals, and personalities
- **Task definitions** (`tasks.yaml`): What each task should accomplish

### REST API Integration
The system uses **REST APIs** (Representational State Transfer) to communicate with Jira:
- **Authentication**: Secure connection to Jira instance
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete tickets
- **Data Exchange**: JSON format for ticket information
